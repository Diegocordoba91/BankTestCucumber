ðŸš€ Project: End-to-End Test Automation Suite â€“ Financial App

Designed and implemented a robust automation suite in Java to validate both UI and backend (REST APIs) of a financial platform. This solution enhanced software quality, enabled continuous delivery, and accelerated release cycles.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack & Tools:

Maven for build and dependency management

BDD with Cucumber, Gherkin for business-readable scenarios

JUnit 5 for structured test execution

Selenium WebDriver for browser automation (via WebDriverManager)

REST Assured for API validations

JavaFaker, Jackson, Log4j/SLF4j for realistic test data and logging

ðŸ§  Best Practices:

Applied Clean Code and SOLID principles

Modular, scalable, and maintainable framework

Integrated tags (@smoke, @regression, @API, @UI) for flexible CI/CD execution

Rich HTML reports via Maven Cucumber Reporting

âœ… What I automated:

UI flows: customer registration, account creation, fund transfers

APIs: customer/account endpoints, transaction history, response validation

This project reflects my expertise in test automation, agile QA, and software engineering best practices, with a strong focus on quality and maintainability.
